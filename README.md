# FxCalc-java

Purpose: create faster and more versatile parachute simulation program with potential for java based GUI
  - could add in rocket flight as well

I have no idea how to organize java code
My idea was to use individual methods for different calculations and tie them all together in the main method
It works but the arguments for the methods are sloppy, not organized well

** could lambda be used for simple calcs like tf and cds?
