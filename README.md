*** This was one of my first java programs, excuse poor code

Purpose: create faster and more versatile parachute simulation program with potential for java based GUI
  - could add in rocket flight as well

Notes:
  - Additional Goal: allow use for Phlanz method from Knacke, compare to ICM & AMM
  - Crazy but potentially doable Goal: Stop using simple tf calculation. actively inflate parachute over time

  - I have no idea how to organize java code. It works but the arguments for the methods are sloppy, not organized well
