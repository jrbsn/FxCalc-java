# FxCalc-java

Purpose: create faster and more versatile parachute simulation program with potential for java based GUI
  - could add in rocket flight as well

Additional Goal: once GUI is created, allow use for Phlanz method from Knacke, compare to ICM & AMM
Crazy but potentially doable Goal: Stop using simple tf calculation. actively inflate parachute over time using scary equations

I have no idea how to organize java code
My idea was to use individual methods for different calculations and tie them all together in the main method
It works but the arguments for the methods are sloppy, not organized well

** could lambda be used for simple calcs like tf and cds?
